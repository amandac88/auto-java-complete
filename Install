;; 1. generate the tag file .
;;
;;     Tags.java uses JDK reflection to generate a tag file by
;;     loading all classes in classpath. What you need to do is
;;     just add your jars to $CLASSPATH. Now it is easy to use 
;;     Tags.java.
;;     Suppose you put all you jar files in /path/to/jars/
;;     even in subdirectory of this directory
;;     and you put all class files in /project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     then you can
;;     export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/path/to/jars/:/project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     or 
;;     export CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME:/path/to/jars/:/project/WEB-INF/classes/
;;     This even will tag all jars in $JAVA_HOME.
;;     It needs about 3~10 mins depending on the number of jars.
;;     During this process, you may see some exceptions. If it doesn't kill
;;     the program, just ignore them.
;;     Run 
;;                 javac Tags.java 
;;                 java Tags
;;     Maybe you need to do:
;;                 java -XX:MaxPermSize=512m Tags
;;
;;     to generate the tag file ~/.java_base.tag.
;;     Or
;;                 java Tags "org\.hello,org\.world"
;;
;;     This would not tag those class names that match
;;     "org.hello" or "org.world"
;;
;;     If it can't work on your computer, use my tag file
;;     java_base.tag.bz2. Just uncompress and rename it to
;;     .java_base.tag and put it in your home directory.
;;     Of course you can change the name by customing
;;                 `ajc-tag-file'
;;     Sometimes AJC can't find the tag file on
;;     Windows for its ugly path like
;;     'C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator'.
;;     You'd better customize 'ajc-tag-file' on Windows.


;;  2. You should have installed auto-complete and yasnippet.
;;     About how to install and config them, you should find
;;     those on the net.

;;  3. Then add this lines in .emacs or youre emacs setting file.

;;       (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/ajc-java-complete/")
;;       (require 'ajc-java-complete-config)
;;       (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'ajc-java-complete-mode)
;;       (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'ajc-4-jsp-find-file-hook)
;;       read ajc-java-complete-config.el for more info.

;;     Restart your emacs, and enjoy.
